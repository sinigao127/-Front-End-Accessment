### Box Model
Every element in CSS is a box. In the center of the box, lies the actual content which is wrap around from inside outwards by the padding, borders, and margins. The padding is inside the borders which includes the background color. Paddings are used to space out the element from itself, while margins are used to space between elements. The margins vertically adjoined each other collapse. By default, the height and width assigned to an element is applied to the content. In most cases, box-sizing is set to border-box in the universal selector, to make browser account for any padding and border in the value of specified width and height.
